		<h1>I know why the caged bird sings</h1>
		<h3>Maya Angelou</h3>
		<p>
		A free bird leaps on the back <br> &nbsp Of the wind and floats downstream <br> &nbsp &nbsp Till the current ends and dips his wing <br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp In the orange suns rays <br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp And dares to claim the sky.
		</p>
		<p>
		&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp But a BIRD that stalks down his narrow cage <br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Can seldom see through his bars of rage <br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp His wings are clipped and his feet are tied <br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp So he opens his throat to sing.
		</p>
		<p>
		&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The caged bird sings with a fearful trill <br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Of things unknown but longed for still <br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp And his tune is heard on the distant hill for <br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The caged bird sings of freedom.
		</p>
		<p>
		&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The free bird thinks of another breeze <br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp And the trade winds soft through <br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The sighing trees <br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp And the fat worms waiting on a dawn-bright <br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Lawn and he names the sky his own.
		</p>
		<p>
		&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp But a caged BIRD stands on the grave of dreams <br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp His shadow shouts on a nightmare scream <br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp His wings are clipped and his feet are tied <br> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp So he opens his throat to sing.
